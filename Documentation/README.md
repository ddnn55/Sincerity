Why Sincerity?
--------------

example\_out.js/cpp demonstrate the core motivation of _Sincerity_. WebGL and OpenGLES are the same API under the hood, it's just that WebGL is programmed from JavaScript, and OpenGLES is programmed from C derivatives (or Java). WebGL and OpenGLES apps end up with the same exact logic and API calls; they differ only in the language used. It would be nice if a programmer of an interactive graphics app (e.g. Angry Birds, Google Maps, data visualizations) could code in one language and target both OpenGLES and WebGL. This is where _Sincerity_ comes in. *CORE*: Code Once, Run Everywhere.

A _Sincerity_ app runs at native speed on the following platforms:
WebGL: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
OpenGLES: iOS, Android
